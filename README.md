# AI Programming with Python Project

## Description 

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## UserStory

AS a user who doesn't know the plants well 
I WANT to know the name of the flowers by putting their picture and get top 5 highest percentage of the name
SO THAT I can narrow down the choices
